        <h2>Sophomore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a sophomore at BJ. I began as a fashion design major, but then I realized that fashion be weird, so now I'm a Biblical counseling major. 
             I'm the middle out of seven, I have three nephews and one niece, and someday I would like to go skydiving.</p>
         <p>
           I love experimenting in the kitchen, trying out all kinds of new recepies. I recently made my own dried cranberries and they turned out amazing.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I enjoy listening to podcasts and having deep conversations. This is actually true.
